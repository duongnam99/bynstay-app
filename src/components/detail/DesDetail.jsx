              A round-the-world trip remains the world’s greatest journey. For two out of every three people, this is the ultimate travel experience, according to recent research. Needless to say, in a world obsessed by travel, travelers and travel agents are both looking for the cheapest tickets and airfares available. Cheap airline tickets, in most cases, can be obtained from wholesale dealers and discounters. If your requirements are simple – you want a round-trip ticket from one place to another, you have a particular airline on your mind and you have definite dates; then you can go directly to the source – to the ticket discount agency which buys cheap tickets in bulk from wholesalers and consolidators.
